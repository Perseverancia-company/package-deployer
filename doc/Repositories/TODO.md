# Repositories to do

## Github integration

- [x] Read all repositories of a user in github
	- [x] Clone them all

## Cancelled

- [-] Clone and combine
This should be interpreted as clone all nodejs repositories, combine and MOVE them into a monorepo.

Not really viable because each repository has their own package-lock, and if you wanted to make a commit you would have to restore the package lock.

## Update repositories

- [x] Update repositories method 1
